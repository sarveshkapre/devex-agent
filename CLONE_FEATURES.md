# Clone Feature Tracker

## Context Sources
- README and docs
- TODO/FIXME markers in code
- Test and build failures
- Gaps found during codebase exploration

## Candidate Features To Do
- [ ] P1 - Add HTML export with a minimal theme and static search (roadmap near-term item).
- [ ] P1 - Improve schema fidelity for `oneOf`/discriminator selection logic (roadmap near-term item).
- [ ] P2 - Add multi-file spec merging support for split OpenAPI specs (roadmap later item).
- [ ] P2 - Add spec diff mode to generate change-focused docs between two versions.

## Implemented
- [x] 2026-02-09 - CI-safe `Makefile` execution for both local `.venv` and CI/global environments.
  - Evidence: `Makefile`, commit `4cc9482`, CI run `21808754489` (success), local `make check`, local `PATH="$(pwd)/.venv/bin:$PATH" make check VENV=.missing`.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Resolved referenced `requestBody` objects and response refs during render.
  - Evidence: `src/devex_agent/generator.py`, `tests/fixtures/request_body_ref.yaml`, `tests/test_generator.py`, commit `727ef02`.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Hardened operation collection against malformed path items/operations.
  - Evidence: `src/devex_agent/generator.py`, `tests/fixtures/malformed_paths.yaml`, `tests/test_generator.py`, commit `727ef02`.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Synchronized docs with real CLI invocation and maintenance release notes.
  - Evidence: `README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Added persistent maintenance memory and incident tracking files.
  - Evidence: `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, `INCIDENTS.md`.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Executed CLI smoke verification path and captured output evidence.
  - Evidence: `devex-agent tests/fixtures/petstore.yaml --output /tmp/devex-agent-smoke.md`, grep checks on `/tmp/devex-agent-smoke.md`.

## Insights
- CI failures across runs `21557668393` through `21557307241` shared the same root cause: `make check` assumed `.venv` activation.
- Typer is currently exposing single-command mode, so docs must use `devex-agent <spec> ...` instead of `devex-agent generate ...`.
- Regression coverage improved by adding fixtures for referenced request bodies and malformed path definitions.
